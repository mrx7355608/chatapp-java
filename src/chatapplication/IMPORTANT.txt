About project:
--------------
This project is a chat application built in java. It have a simple GUI
with a connect button that connects a user with server, a text box for sending messages
and a scrollable textarea to display messages of other users

Project must have:
------------------
1. A GUI for sending and receiving messages (done)
2. A client should be able to send & receive messages from server (done)
3. A server should broadcast messages to all connected clients (done)


Components of the project:
--------------------------

Server side components:
======================
1. A server class for accepting connections and storing connected clients.
2. A class for receiving client messages and broadcasting them

Spawn a thread for each client that connects to our server for receiving 
messages. Because waiting for clients for a message blocks the main thread 
on which our server is running, which will cause the server to stop 
accepting new connections.

Also you need to share list of clients that are connected, between threads 
in order to broadcast message.


Client side components:
=======================
1. A client class with connect, disconnect, and sendMessage methods.
2. A class for receiving broadcast messages from server
3. GUI with a connect button, textbox and a textarea.
4. Integrate Client functionalities with GUI

For 2, you need to spawn a thread for receiving broadcast messages
